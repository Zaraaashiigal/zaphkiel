# Zaphkiel
A steam spying toolkit! EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE YOU ADDED! <br />
This will automatically update you with tray notifications based on what the activity of that person is. <br />
You'll always be catching up with their doings throughout the day. Timestamp logfiles coming soon, so you can make out routines. ^^ <br />
This uses electron, btw!
# How to use?
npm install<br />
npm start<br />
You must simply get your webAPI key, put it in the input.<br />
Then get the steamID64, which is the communityID, of your target.<br />
Hit attach to scanner and you add this person to your watchlist and will get tray notifications of what that person is doing. That means everytime something changes in their activity, you will be the first to notice!<br />
